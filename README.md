# LaTeX-commons

LaTeX packages for definitions I generally reuse across projects such as titlepage styling.

## Installation

Clone the repository in your TeX distribution local package folder.
Exact location depends on your OS, look at [this post from StackExchange](http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/1167)
or run `kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME` to get it.
